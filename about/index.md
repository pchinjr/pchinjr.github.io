Well, I don't know where to begin. I like making things, and now I want to make things on the internet.  

I have been fortunate enough to have a lot of different experiences in many facets of life. Hopefully I can finally tie them together with creative problem solving, a little bit of code, and a lot of love. 

## What are my favorite things?:

* Robots
* The Internet  
* Photography 
* Art
* Music
* Cats
* Community Projects
* Collaborating
* Food
* Cooking
* Eating
* Economics
* Business

Give me a shout about any of these things: [pchinjr@gmail.com](mailto:pchinjr@gmail.com)
