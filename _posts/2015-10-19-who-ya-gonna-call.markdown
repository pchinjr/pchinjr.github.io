# The First Project

After I completed a few tutorials at Codecademy, I was itching to put it into practice. The hardest part about teaching myself is staying motivated. In order to not get burned out on tutorials and sample projects creating fake portfolios, I decided to use my eight year old brain and play make believe. That's right, the skills I learned from Mr. Rogers and Sesame Street are keeping me in the game. I am now pretending that The Ghostbusters have hired me to be their web developer. Their first task for me was to get a new shiny marketing website. 

This was a great project to start with because I know a lot about the Ghostbusters. The hard part about building a website is knowing the content. With the Ghostbusters, I already knew about their history and brand promise. I found a fun template to start with and customized it from there. The process took me about a week to complete. It was the first time I had used github, cloud9, bootstrap, font awesome, and a hosting service. My only previous expereince making websites was Geocities, WordPress, and Squarespace. Now I was creating a static site that fit the client's needs. 

From my experience in marketing, I knew the site had to present their services and let potential clients get in contact with them. I had a lot of fun adding flavor text and adding all the appropriate movie references. 

So if you are just getting started making website, take a second and build something that you geek out about and imagine all the things you want to say about it.
