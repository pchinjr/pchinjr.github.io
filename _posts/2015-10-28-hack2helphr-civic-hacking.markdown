## Civic Hacakathons 
I like to dive in head first when learning how to do something because there's no substitute for getting hands on experience. I have been aware of our local code brigade, **[Code For Hampton Roads](http://www.code4hr.org)**, for a while now but had never gotten involved until this past weekend at the Dominon Enterprises civic hackathon. Even though I've been to hackathons before, this was my first time participating in the build process and my first community oriented build. 

It was really refreshing to see the teams working on things that would help everyone in the region and not just another twitter clone. 

## What I learned 

I was fortunate to work with a great team that I met through the local developer groups. For the first time I experienced what it was like to go through UI development. It began with sketches on paper and then turned over to be turned into views for the Android app. 

## What was built
