# Going Global 

## why export? 
- higher sales 
- growing fast markets
- preserving domestic markets
- learn from foreign competition 


*it doesnt matter where you are, you are already competing in a global market. The foreign competition is looking in.*

The American market is the most transparent and the easiest to access, it's the easiest to scale. 

There's a great danger to premature scaling. There's a cost to replicating your businesss. 

- diversification 
- extending life cylces
- leveraging global brands 

It's really hard to estimate your overhead prematurely. 

## Are you export ready? 
- committed management
- in depth experience with the product
- adequate cash flow
- it takes 12 months to get into a market, you must be commited to allocating financial resources
